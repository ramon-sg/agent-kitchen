/**
 * @file What agent-kitchen knows of each piece it manages, and the names they share. A piece
 * (the version of skills-manager, the issue flow, claude-cloud, claude-repo-guard, the
 * skills, the rule in AGENTS.md) tells what the repo has and the steps that would install or
 * update it; agent-kitchen shows them, lets the person pick, and runs the picked ones in
 * order. Every step runs the piece's own tool, which owns its files: agent-kitchen only
 * writes the few lines that join two pieces, the one line of AGENTS.md, which has no tool,
 * and the version of skills-manager in package.json, which agent-kitchen is the one to run.
